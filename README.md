## Static Website on AWS EC2

This project I deployed a simple static website on AWS EC2 using NGINX as the web server. 
The website includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and mentions the HNG Internship with a link to [HNG](https://hng.tech). 

## Setup for the Deployment
1. Launch an EC2 instance on AWS.
2. Install NGINX on the EC2 instance.
3. Upload the static website files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to the EC2 instance.
4. Configure NGINX to serve the static website.
5. Access the website through the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
